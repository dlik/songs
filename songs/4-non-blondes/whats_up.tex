    \beginverse
        Twenty-five years and my life is still
        Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
        For a destination
        I realized quickly when I knew I should
        That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
        For whatever that means
    \endverse
    \beginverse*{\textbf{Pre-Chorus}}
        And so I cry sometimes
        When I'm lying in bed just to get it all out
        What's in my head
        And I, I am feeling a little peculiar
        And so I wake in the morning
        And I step outside
        And I take a deep breath and I get real high
        And I scream from the top of my lungs
        What's going on?
    \endverse
    \beginchorus{\textbf{Chorus}}
        And I say, hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah
        I said hey, what's going on?
        And I say, hey yeah yeah, hey yeah yeah
        I said hey, what's going on?
    \endchorus
    \beginverse*
        Oh, oh oh
        Oh, oh oh
    \endverse
    \beginverse
        And I try, oh my god do I try
        I try all the time, in this institution
        And I pray, oh my god do I pray
        I pray every single day
        For a revolution
    \endverse

        Oh, oh oh oh
