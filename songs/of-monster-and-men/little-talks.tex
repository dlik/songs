    \[Am]I don't like walki\[Fmaj7]ng around this \[C]old and empty house
    \textit{So \[Am]hold my hand, I'll \[F]walk with you my d\[C]ear}
    The stairs creak as I sleep, it's keeping me awake
    \textit{It's the house telling you to close your eyes}
    Some days I can't even trust myself
    \textit{It's killing me to see you this way}
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
    \textit{Tell her that I miss our little talks}
    Soon it will be over and buried with our past
    \textit{We used to play outside when we were young (and full of life and full of love)}
    Some days I don't know if I am wrong or right
    \textit{Your mind is playing tricks on you my dear}
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    'Cause though the truth may vary
    This ship will carry
    Our bodies safe to shore  Hey!
    Don't listen to a word I say. Hey!
    The screams all sound the same. Hey!
    'Cause though the truth may vary
    This ship will carry
    Our bodies safe to shore
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    \textit{(calmly)}
    \[Am]You're gone, gone, gone away. I watched you disappear
    \[Am]All that's left is a ghost of you
    Now we're \[Am]torn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do. 
    Just \[Am]let me go, we'll meet again soon.
    \textit{(get faster)}
    Now \[Am]wait, \[Fmaj7]wait, wait for me. \[C]Please hang around
    I \[Am]see you when I \[Fmaj7]fall a\[C]sleep. \[G]Hey!
