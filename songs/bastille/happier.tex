    \begin{verse*}{\textbf{Intro}}
      \[Am7]Lately, I've been, \[G]I've been \[C]thinking
      I want you \[Em]to be \[Fmaj7/C]happier, I want you \[Em]to be \[Fmaj7/C]happier
    \end{verse*}

    \begin{verse}
      When the morning \[Am7]comes
      When we see what \[G]we've be\[C]come
      In the cold light of \[Em]day, we're a \[Fmaj7/C]flame in the wind
      Not the fire that \[Em]we've be\[Fmaj7/C]gun
      Every \[G]argu\[Am7]ment, every word we \[G]can't take \[C]back
      'Cause with all that \[Em]has happened
      I \[Fmaj7/C]think that we both know the way that this \[Em]story \[Fmaj7/C]ends \[G]
    \end{verse}

    \begin{chorus}
      Then \[Am7]only for a minute \[G] \[C]
      I want to \[Em]change my \[Fmaj7/C]mind
      'Cause this just don't feel \[Fmaj7/C]right to me \[G]
      I \[Am7]wanna raise your spirits \[G] \[C]
      I want to \[Em]see you sm\[Fmaj7/C]ile but
      Know that means I'll \[Fmaj7/C]have to leave      
    \end{chorus}

    \begin{chorus}
      \[Am7] \[G]\[C] \[Em] \[Fmaj7] Know that \[Em]means I'll \[Fmaj7/C]have to leave\[G]
      \[Am7]Lately, I've been, \[G]I've been \[C]thinking
      I want you \[Em]to be \[Fmaj7/C]happier, I want you \[Em]to be \[Fmaj7/C]happier
    \end{chorus}

    \begin{verse}
      When the evening \[Am7]falls
      And I'm left there \[G]with my th\[C]oughts
      And the image of \[Em]you being \[Fmaj7/C]with someone else
      Well, it's eating me \[Em]up \[Fmaj7/C]inside
      But we \[G]ran our \[Am7]course, we pretended \[G]we're ok\[C]ay
      Now if we jump to\[Em]gether, at \[Fmaj7/C]least we can swim
      Far away from the \[Em]wreck we \[Fmaj7]made \[G]
    \end{verse}

    \begin{chorus}
      Then \[Am7]only for a minute \[G] \[C]
      I want to \[Em]change my \[Fmaj7/C]mind

      I \[Am7]wanna raise your spirits \[G] \[C]
      I want to \[Em]see you sm\[Fmaj7/C]ile but
      Know that means I'll \[Fmaj7/C]have to leave

    \end{chorus}

    \begin{verse*}
      So I'll \[Am7]go, I'll \[C]go
      I will \[G]go, go, \[Am7]go
      So I'll \[Fmaj7/C]go, I'll \[C]go
