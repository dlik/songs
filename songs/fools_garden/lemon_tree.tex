  \begin{verse}
    I'm \[Am]sitting here in the \[Em]boring room
    It's \[Am]just another rainy Sunday \[Em]afternoon
    I'm \[Am]wasting my time, I got \[Em]nothing to do
    I'm \[Am]hanging around, I'm \[Em]waiting for you
    But \[Dm]nothing ever happens \[Em] and I \[Am]wonder
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    I'm driving around in my car
    I'm driving too fast, I'm driving too far
    I'd like to change my point of view
    I feel so lonely, I'm waiting for you
    But nothing ever happens and I wonder
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    I \[C]wonder how, I \[G]wonder why
    \[Am]Yesterday you told me 'bout the \[Em]blue blue sky
    And \[F]all that I can \[G]see
    Is just a yellow \[C]lemon-tree\[G7]
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{chorus}
    I'm turning my head up and down
    I'm turning turning turning turning turning around
    And all that I can see
    Is just another lemon-tree
  \end{chorus}

  \begin{verse}
    \textit{(Sing)} Dab, dadada da da di dadab ...    
    I'm sitting here, I miss the power
    I'd like to go out taking a shower
    But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
    I feel so tired, put myself into bed
    Well, nothing ever happens and I wonder
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse}
    \[E]Isolation \[Am]is not good for me
    \[G]Isolation \[C]I don't want to
    Sit on the \[E]lemon-tree
  \end{verse}

  \begin{verse*}
    I'm steppin' around in the desert of joy
    Baby anyhow I'll get another toy
    And everything will happen and you wonder
  \end{verse*}
