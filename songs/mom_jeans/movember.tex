            \beginverse{\textbf{Verse 1: Mom Jeans}}
                \[^G]Why you gotta be so \[B7]fuckin' mean?
                \[Cmaj7]Said it's not your \[Cadd9]scene, could you \[F9]just leave me\[G]
                Alone with my friends, alone with my thoughts?
                But I often have thoughts that can't be shared and
                If you really cared about my health, about my heart
                Then you would start keeping track of all the times
                You said that you were fine but really weren't
                It's just like back in time when you were five
                The doctor said you would be fine, but
                It still hurt and I'm still sure it was just a little trick to make us feel all right

            \beginverse{\textbf{Verse 2: Sarah Levy}}
                Now I smell like smoke, and I feel like shit
                Probably couldn't hurt if we took a dip
                Then I'll finally be as clean as I felt back at eighteen
            \endverse


            \beginchorus{\textbf{Chorus: Sarah Levy \& Mom Jeans}}
                'Cause I'm not getting any younger
                My lungs get blacker every day
                If I were to grow a beard, stop drinking beer, I fear you might not love me enough to make you stay

                I really hope you'll stay
