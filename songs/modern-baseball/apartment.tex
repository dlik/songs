        {\nolyrics \[D]}
        \[D]The first time I saw you was in your apartment
        \[D/C]I had followed my friends single-file through the darkness
        \[Em]I looked your direction for excessive inspection
        And I could \[A]not muster the courage to say a single word
    \endverse

    \beginverse
        {\nolyrics \[D]}
        \[D]For a while we were playing this game that your friends bought
        \[D/C]But everyone cheated and no one could spell
        \[Em]You didn't say much of anything
        I must have \[G]come off annoying, cause \[A]you went to bed
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        \[Em]I walk home \[A]with my eyes low
        \[D]Dreaming up \[D/C#]conver\[D/B]sations we'll have tomorrow
        \[Em]Your loose ends, \[A]my new friends
        \[D]All the \[D/C#]classes in \[D/B]high school we fell \[Em]asleep in
        But now I can hardly close my \[A]eyes
    \endchorus

    \endverse

    \beginverse
        \[D]The next time I saw you was in your apartment
        Oh, \[D/C]why do I keep ending up here on starlit evenings?
        \[Em]I should be home sleeping
        But this time you \[G]sat next to me on the \[A]couch (dude, nice!)
    \endverse

    \beginverse
        \[D]I stare out the window
        \[D/C]Hands glued tight and sore
        Praying to \[Em]God-knows-what that you would sever what's stuck
        With something \[G]shiny from the kitchen \[A]drawer
    \endverse

    \beginchorus
        \[Em]I walk home \[A]with my eyes low
        \[D]Dreaming up \[D/C#]conver\[D/B]sations we'll have tomorrow
        \[Em]Your loose ends, \[A]my new friends
        \[D]All the \[D/C#]classes in \[D/B]high school we fell \[Em]asleep in
        But now I can hardly close my \[A]eyes
    \endchorus

    \beginverse
        I was \[D]wondering if, maybe, you \[D/C]wanted to hang out \[D/B]tonight
        We could make \[D/A#]dinner or something
    \endverse
