            \beginverse
            On the first part of the journey
            I was looking at all the life
            There were plants and birds and rocks and things
            There was sand and hills and rings

            The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
            And the sky with no clouds
            The heat was hot and the ground was dry
            But the air was full of sound
            \endverse

            \beginchorus{\textbf{Chorus}}
            I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
            It felt good to be out of the rain
            In the desert you can remember your name
            'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
            La, la, \dots
            \endchorus

            \beginverse
            After two days in the desert sun
            My skin began to turn red
            After three days in the desert fun
            I was looking at a river bed
            And the story it told of a river that flowed
            Made me sad to think it was dead
            \endverse

            \beginchorus{Chorus}
            \endchorus

            \beginverse
            After nine days I let the horse run free
            'Cause the desert had turned to sea
            There were plants and birds and rocks and things
            there was sand and hills and rings
            The ocean is a desert with it's life underground
            And a perfect disguise above
            Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
            But the humans will give no love
            \endverse
